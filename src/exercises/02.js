// window.FETCH_TIME = 3000
// If you want to make an actual network call for the pokemon
// then uncomment the following line
// window.fetch.restoreOriginalFetch()
// Note that by doing this, the FETCH_TIME will no longer be considered
// and if you want to slow things down you should use the Network tab
// in your developer tools to throttle your network to something like "Slow 3G"

// üê® Your goal is to refactor this traditional useEffect-style async
// interaction to suspense with resources. Enjoy!
